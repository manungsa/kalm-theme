## What's this?

Just a random colorscheme that I made for fun (cuz I didn't really like other
colorschemes :p ).

The original JSON file was generated from Monokai theme, but I didn't change
some of them because I only really focus on the syntax color.

So I can sort of say that this theme isn't really "complete".

But yeah, I hope you like this theme :) .
